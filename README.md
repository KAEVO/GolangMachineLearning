# Golang Machine Learning Library

## Structure:

* **core** - base functions/structures package;
* **datasets** - datasets for testing;
* **paper** - a text justification of relevance, results compilation, conclusions;
* **speed_tests** - speed tests for the solution of linear algebra tasks and learning algorithms in different languages (libraries): C++ (mlpack, armadillo), Python (numpy, sklearn), Golang (gonum);
* **supervisedlearning** - supervised learning algorithms;
* **unsupervisedlearning** - unsupervised learning algorithms.
